I was trying to create a TcpClient to test a connection. on the test machine i got a something like `Specified argument was out of the range of valid values parameter name port`

but it had notching to do with the TcpClient

```csharp
var uri = new Uri(address);
var client = new TcpClient(uri.Host, uri.Port);
```

Apparently the `uri.Port` was `-1` the default while with the address `dad-czxdad-7.euro.test.com:9094`
i expected the port to be `9094`.

`PLAINTEXT://dad-czxdad-7.euro.test.com:9094`
