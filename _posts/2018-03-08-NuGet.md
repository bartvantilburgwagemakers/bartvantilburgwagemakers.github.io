This will be my first post for now just to experiment how this will work. I if u can work with it.

## reinstall all nuget packages for sln in vs

Run: `Update-Package -safe -reinstall -IgnoreDependencies` in the package manger console Tools>NUget>Console

## Updating Assembly Redirects with NuGet

Run: `Get-Project â€“All | Add-BindingRedirect`
Remove -all to do it only on the current project.

## Install the cli

`choco install nuget.commandline`

## Add a NuGet source with token

Must do this  with the command line.
`nuget.exe sources add -name [name] -source [https://uri] -userName [anything] -password [accessToken]`

## Clear nuget caches

`nuget locals all -clear`
