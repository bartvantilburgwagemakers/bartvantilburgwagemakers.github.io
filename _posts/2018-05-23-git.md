## How to write Git commit messages

It's a good habit to make sure you commit messages read i way that they tell wat they change in your code.

* [a blog post on writing commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## Pull requests

Make sure that you come with suggestions.
Explain why you think something is better.

## History

### Change the history

With actions that change the history like amend, rebase, ec. You have to make sure that you don't effect others or communicate with them about it.
Also a squash commits makes on a branch makes if difficult to rebase on it.

#### Interactive rebase

With a interactive rebase you're able to rewrite a range of commits. Like change the message squash a few together and other things.

### Find the commits and changes for a line

With this command in the git bash shell you get get a list of the changed. You need to fill in the path from the git root.
`L59,62` stand for between line 59 and 60.
```bash
$ git log -L59,62:Main/Src/Common/Common/PetroSignsConfiguration.cs
```
