## How to write Git commit messages

It's a good habit to make sure you commit messages read i way that they tell wat they change in your code.

- [a blog post on writing commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## Pull requests

Make sure that you come with suggestions.
Explain why you think something is better.

## History

### Change the history

With actions that change the history like amend, rebase, ec. You have to make sure that you don't effect others or communicate with them about it.
Also a squash commits makes on a branch makes if difficult to rebase on it.

### Find the commits and changes for a line

With this command in the git bash shell you get get a list of the changed. You need to fill in the path from the git root.
`L59,62` stand for between line 59 and 60.

```bash
$ git log -L59,62:Main/Src/Common/Common/PetroSignsConfiguration.cs
```

## Long file paths

See this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22575662/filename-too-long-in-git-for-windows)

Git has a limit of 4096 characters for a filename, except on Windows when Git is compiled with msys. It uses an older version of the Windows API and there's a limit of 260 characters for a filename.
So as far as I understand this, it's a limitation of msys and not of Git. You can read the details here: https://github.com/msysgit/git/pull/110
You can circumvent this by using another Git client on Windows or set core.longpaths to true as explained in other answers.
`git config --system core.longpaths true`

Means you can push whatever you have now, but the develops need to invoke `git config --system core.longpaths true`

To remove old local branches that are not online use:
