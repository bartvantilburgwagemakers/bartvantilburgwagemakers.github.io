A few hidden things in windows.

## Easy overview for changing settings

If you want easy access to a whole host of tweaking options, look no further than this other ancient, yet oft-forgotten enthusiast tweak: God Mode. This Easter Egg consolidates a massive amount of power user settings into a single, easy-to-parse interface. The options are grouped into logical categories based on task types, such as “Administrative tools,” “Ease of access center,” and “System.” It’s great.

Create a new folder and leave it empty. (I like to plop God Mode on my desktop.) Then right-click the folder, select Rename, and give it the following name:

`OverviewConfig.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}.`

Just cut and paste that in to be sure you don’t make any typos. Feel free to change the text before the first period, which gives the folder its name—if you aren’t keen on the traditional `Overview` moniker, you can change it to whatever pleases you. Press Enter to save the name change, and the folder’s icon will change to mimic the Control Panel’s image. Open up and bask in God Mode’s fully unified glory.
