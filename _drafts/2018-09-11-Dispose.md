Disposing is for unmanaged resources if the are none try something lik a release method or close.

## the dispose pattern

JetBrains and microsoft use different name for the methods but the idee is almost the same.

With resharper you can use alt+Insert dispose pattern.

This will generate methods with one called release unmanaged Resources.

Microsoft examples show a `protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)` method. If you want to override a dispose method it should be this one and not the `dispose()`

```csharp
using System;

class BaseClass : IDisposable
{
   // Flag: Has Dispose already been called?
   bool disposed = false;

   // Public implementation of Dispose pattern callable by consumers.
    public void Dispose()
    {
    // Dispose of unmanaged resources.
        Dispose(true);
    // Suppress finalization.
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
// Protected implementation of Dispose pattern.
   protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
   {
      if (disposed)
         return;

      if (disposing) {
         // Free any other managed objects here.
         //
      }

      // Free any unmanaged objects here.
      //
      disposed = true;
   }

 ~BaseClass()
   {
      Dispose(false);
   }
```

The `GC.SuppressFinalize(this);` is to prevent the Garbage collector from calling finalize.

## GarbageCollector

The GC wil need two collection rounds for this example code.

### Round 1

    Calling the `Dispose()` method

### Round 2

    This is for the finalize `~BaseClass` method.
