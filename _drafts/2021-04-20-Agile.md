## common mistakes

- Management or other parts of the company don't want to change how there are doings things.
- No retrospective that create actual actions for improvement.
- Deadlines and tanking estimates as reals time.
- [Iron cross](##1-iron-cross)
- DOR & DOD
- Documentation 
- There is no plan when the should be a plan.
- Not enough  information (like the business value)
- Only telling what they think the want instead of the problem they want to have solved 
- Not every one is equal 
- No room for refactoring and testing 
- No ownership of domains and services
- No interaction with the users 
 

Agile produces data and this data will most likely destroy the hope that every thing can be done in time. The velocity of a team is one of these metrics. And stile there are 'agile teams' that are not recording these metrics.

After a few sprints a lot of projects will see that the can't do every thing they hoped for in the in the beginning of the project. 

## For mangers.

 Velocity will remove hope and help to focus on the realistic outcome 

In Story points 

Planning accordantly but refine en dor en dod 

Hope let you say things like I think we are going fine and should be able to make it in time But where is the data to support that?

How precise do you want your estimate's the preciser the more time it will take to Come up with them. 


### Iron cross and Project management triangle

The iron cross of management:
![iron cross](../assets/ironCross.svg)
These are the options for management to mange the project by making changes to the schedule, the scope, the qualities and the staff.

### adjusting the schedule 

So the usually means delaying the project. And often the stakeholders of the project will say that that is interfering with bunnies reasons because that date was picked for a reason in the first place. ( often with  looking at a feasible this is )

### adding staff

A other option mangers often will think of is adding staff. But this will decrease the velocities of the teams in the beginning. A thing that is often not good understood. But new people will need help and guidance to get up to speed in a project. And that will take time from the old team members. While they are helping the new once they can't work on the other items.

## For devs

Is software is called so because it s should be easy to adjust a just weeks it would be hardware 

Agile so it should flexible. And it can only be flexible if it's not too complex we should aim for simple am clear architecture. And to that simple weer should refactor a lot. Els it will become more complex over time.

But a common thing that prevent this is fear. Fear of breaking things, but also fear for thing we do understand anymore or because this are just to big. A great solution to prevent this is have a good set of automatic tests. So that when ever you make a change you can know that you've broken something. And usually the faster you have this kind of feedback the easier it becomes to fix it. 
That's why unit test should be the biggest group of tests. This is of course not always possible. So try the  [strangler pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html).

### Testing

### Simple design

The more complex the more difficult it become to make changes and the easier it become to make mistake. 

[galls law](https://ardalis.com/simple-systems-galls-law/) states that over time if will become more complex. And you don't want to throw the code a way after a certain 'expiration date'. So it's important to clean up or refactor that code. There are some mangers that tell you that time should not be spent on thing like refactoring an writing tests. But do you tell then how they should do there job. So way should they? They should only tell you wat not how.

- Flow of dependency's 
- Naming 
- Break up big classes and method's

### Work on the correct things
