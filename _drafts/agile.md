## Common mistakes

- Deadlines and tanking estimates as reals time 
- [Iron cross](##1-iron-cross)
- DOR & DOD
- Documentation 
- There is a plan 
- Not enough  information (like the business value)
- Only telling what they think the want instead of the problem they want to have solved 
- Not every one is equal 
- No room for refactoring and testing 
- No ownership of domains and services
- No interaction with the users 
 

## Agile

Agile produces data and this data will most likely destroy the hope that every thing can be done in time. The velocity of a team is one of these metrics. And stile there are 'agile teams' that are not recording these metrics.

After a few sprints a lot of projects will see that the can't do every thing they hoped for in the in the beginning of the project. 

## Iron cross and Project management triangle

The iron cross of management:

These are the options for management to mange the project by making changes to the schedule, the scope, the qualities and the staff.

### adjusting the schedule 

So the usually means delaying the project. And often the stackholders of the project will say that that is interfering with bunnies reasons because that date was picked for a reason in the first place. ( often with  looking at a feasible this is )

### adding staff

A other option mangers often will think of is adding staff. But this will decrease the velocities of the teams in the beginning. A thing that is often not good understood. But new people will need help and guidance to get up to speed in a project. And that will take time from the old team members. While they are helping the new once they can't work on the other items.
